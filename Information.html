	Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and
	solar radiation that bounced off the earth's surface. Other things that cause global warming is the several gases that mankind produces such as gases.
	Some of those gases can be produced by Coal-Burning power plants. Global warming is caused by the increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, 
	and other pollutants.

	different parts of different countries. Other things that have been occuring is things such as the sea levels rising. Many of these changes in weather
